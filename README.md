# Portfolio
## About me üë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<p align="justify">My name is Magdalena Kustwan. I graduated from Silesian University of Technology, faculty Environmental Engineering. Currently I'm working as an assistant of a gas pipelines designer. I have 8 years of experience in designing, creating technical ducumentation.
<br>I want to rebrand and become at first <strong>manual tester</strong> but ultimately I want to develop towards <strong>automated testing.</strong>
<br>Working as a tester gives a lot of <strong>possibilities to develop, requires commitment and continuous training</strong> - and this values I appreciate a lot.
<br>My goal is to develop my knowledge and technical skills in the testing area. I want to get to know JavaScript (and I'm also open for learning another programming languages) and tools which are used in automated testing.
<br>Thanks to my work experience I develop interpersonal skills to work successfully with all of my team members. I think this experience would be very helpfull in a work connected with testing.
<br>In this portfolio I would like to show my <strong>testing knowledge and technical skills</strong>, which I gained through self-learning and through taking part in courses connected with testing.
<br>I am determined to develop my knowledge and technical skills in testing area and my first goal is to get a job as a <strong>junior software tester.</strong></p>

## Soft skillsüó£Ô∏è
Working as an assistant of a gas pipelines designer has strengthened my following skills:

* <strong>Adaptability</strong> - I always keep an open mind and I embrace changes,
* <strong>Time management</strong> - working as an assistant of a designer taught me how to manage my time in a proper way to be successfull in my work,
