# Portfolio
## About me üë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<p align="justify">My name is Magdalena Kustwan. I graduated from Silesian University of Technology, faculty Environmental Engineering. Currently I'm working as an assistant of a gas pipelines designer. I have 9 years of experience in designing and creating technical ducumentation.
<br>I want to rebrand and become <strong>automation tester</strong> and constantly develop towards <strong>automated testing.</strong>
<br>Working as a tester gives a lot of <strong>possibilities to develop, requires commitment and continuous training</strong> - and this values I appreciate a lot.
<br>My goal is to develop my knowledge and technical skills in the testing area.
<br>I have become acquainted with <strong>Java Programming Language</strong> and nowadays I'm constantly expanding my knowledge connected with automating testing.
<br>I have become familiar with:
<br>1.<strong> Selenium WebDriver</strong> automation framework for automating browser-related test cases,
<br>2.<strong> Rest Assured</strong> Java-based library for testing RESTful APIs.
<br>At this moment my goal is to harden my knowledge connected with Selenium WebDriver and Rest Assured and getting to know new tools which are used in automated testing.
<br>Thanks to my work experience I develop interpersonal skills to work successfully with all of my team members. I think this experience would be very helpfull in a work connected with testing.
<br>In this portfolio I would like to show my <strong>testing knowledge and technical skills</strong>, which I gained through self-learning and through taking part in courses connected with testing.
<br>I am determined to develop my knowledge and technical skills in testing area and my first goal is to get a job as a <strong>junior software tester.</strong></p>

## Tech skills üñ•
<p align="justify">I took part in Dare IT "QA manual testing" in which I have tested several apps (web apps and mobile apps). 
<br>During this challenge I've created test cases, reported bugs and created Summary Test Report. </p>

I have knowledge in the field of:
* <strong>Software testing</strong>,
* <strong>Creating test cases</strong>,
* <strong>Reporting bugs</strong>,
* <strong>SQL</strong> - SQL commands which I know are compiled in my portoflio for Dare IT Challenge: 
1. [SQL part 1](https://github.com/MagdalenaKustwan/challenge_portfolio_magda#TASK-5),
2. [SQL part 2](https://github.com/MagdalenaKustwan/challenge_portfolio_magda#TASK-6),
* <strong>Postman</strong> - basic level.
  
I have created two projects in <strong>Java Programming Language</strong>:
1. <p align="justify">First of them concern automating browser-related test cases by <strong>Selenium WebDriver with Java </strong>on a webpage https://rahulshettyacademy.com/client. In this particular project I have used <strong>Page Object Model</strong> design pattern.</p>
2. <p align="justify">Second of them involve API testing with <strong>Rest Assured library</strong>. In this project I have used <strong>Cucumber software tool</strong> and I have created some test cases for https://www.themoviedb.org.</p>

## Soft skillsüó£Ô∏è
Working as an assistant of a gas pipelines designer has strengthened my following skills:
* <strong>Teamwork</strong> and <strong>communication</strong> - since I've finished my studies I'm working in a design team, so I thrive in a team environment,
* <strong>Adaptability</strong> - I always keep an open mind and I embrace changes,
* <strong>Time management</strong> - working as an assistant of a designer taught me how to manage my time in a proper way to be successfull in my work,
* <strong>Problem solving</strong> and <strong>critical thinking</strong> - in my current work there's a lot of problematic situations so I develop the ability of choosing the best solution to a particular situation.
